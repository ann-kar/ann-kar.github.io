                        Hi!
                        I am what you might call an "aspiring" coder.
                        I've started to code a good year ago, realized it was even more fun than expected,
                        and decided to turn my career around. As of now (May 2022), I'm looking for my first job
                        as a front-end developer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In March and April, I have completed an amazing internship at ElPassion, which allowed me to learn not only how to code, but how to work as a coder (teamwork, git, tests, time estimates, remote work).
                        Besides, my education includes courses focused on JavaScript and Node.js
                        (<Link href="https://www.incopolska.org/incode">INCODE</Link>)
                        or React.js (<Link href="https://szkolareacta.pl/zapisy/">React School</Link> (PL))
                        and countless hours spent tinkering with my own projects.
                    </p>

                        I've been recently participating in <Link href="https://challenges.dareit.io/">Dare IT: Portfolio Challenge</Link> programme and eagerly learning TypeScript.<br />

                    <p>
                        Web development will be a new path in my career life - up till now, I've worked as a Polish translator with English
                        and Japanese. A list of my literary translations is available <Link href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17193907.Anna_Karpiuk?from_search=true&from_srp=true">here</Link>.

                    <p>
                        If you know a place where I would be a good fit, let me know!
